# 4611Projects
A set of 6 graphics assignments I did as part of the UMN Course CSCI 4611: Interactive 3D Graphics. 

These were all programmed using the University of Minnesota GopherGFX Library, by Evan Suma Rosenberg. Documentation can be found at: <https://illusioneering.github.io/GopherGfx/>. The github can be found here: <https://github.com/illusioneering/GopherGfx>. 

This graphics library is designed to teach coders about graphics and design, but still be very similar to the libraries used in real world applications. 

### Assignment 1: Text Rain
You can see an example of this app running at <https://csci-4611-fall-2023.github.io/assignment-1-Odonn159/>. 

This is a classic interactive graphic game/exhibit. The program takes in as input a video, either one of the provided downloads, or live camera, either of which can be selected in the top right corner. It then drops a bunch of raining characters, stopping and going up when interacting with darker pixels. This application works best with a light background and dark characters, like those seen in ./TextRainInput.mp4. 

### Assignment 2: Hole in the Ground
